## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
 - Instagram
 - X
 - Opal

 - I like the ability to engage with other's posts
 - algorithms that cater to your interests
 - talking to people on X or seeing people that are interested in the same things as me
 - Opal because it blocks apps from your phone allowing you to be more productive instead of doomscrolling all the time

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- figuring out where everything was in XCode
